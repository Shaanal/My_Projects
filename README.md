# My Portfolio Website

Here is the first version of my portfolio website.

I built a responsive multi-page portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on layout design, custom animations, and user interaction. The site included dedicated sections for projects, resume, and contact information, and was deployed via GitHub Pages as a personal showcase of front-end development fundamentals. I hadn't done big projects then, and didn't upload the ones I did either. So the project section is really lacking.
