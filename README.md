Relational Algebra DBMS (SimpleRA)

We implemented a simplified relational database management system in C++ to process basic SQL-like queries using relational algebra operations. The project included buffer management, indexing, and external algorithms such as 2-pass merge sort to efficiently handle large datasets that do not fit in memory.
